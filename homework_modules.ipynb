    "One of the most significant recent ideas that impacted NNs a lot is [**Batch normalization**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). The idea is simple, yet effective: the features should be whitened ($mean = 0$, $std = 1$) all the way through NN. This improves the convergence for deep models letting it train them for days but not weeks. **You are** to implement the first part of the layer: features normalization. The second part (`ChannelwiseScaling` layer) is implemented below.\n",

Это происходит из-за того, что параметры предыдущих слоев изменяются во время обучения, влияя на данные текущего слоя.\n",

If BatchNormalization is placed after a linear transformation layer (including dense layer, convolutions, channelwise scaling) that implements function like `y = weight * x + bias`, than bias adding become useless and could be omitted since its effect will be discarded while batch mean subtraction. If BatchNormalization (followed by `ChannelwiseScaling`) is placed before a layer that propagates scale (including ReLU, LeakyReLU) followed by any linear transformation layer than parameter `gamma` in `ChannelwiseScaling` could be freezed since it could be absorbed into the linear transformation layer.\n",

Если пакетная нормализация размещена после слоя линейного преобразования (включая плотный слой, свертки, масштабирование по каналам), который реализует функцию типа y = weight * x + bias, то добавление смещения становится бесполезным и может быть опущено, поскольку его эффект будет отброшен при вычитании пакетного среднего. Если пакетная нормализация (за которой следует масштабирование по каналам) помещается перед слоем, который увеличивает масштаб (включая ReLU, LeakyReLU), за которым следует любой слой линейного преобразования, то параметр gamma в масштабировании по каналам может быть заблокирован, поскольку он может быть поглощен слоем линейного преобразования."
